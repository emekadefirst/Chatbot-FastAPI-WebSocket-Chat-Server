# ChatGPT FastAPI WebSocket Chat Server

This repository contains a simple WebSocket chat server built with FastAPI and integrated with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for generating responses to user messages.

## Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

## Usage

To run the server, execute the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Connecting to the WebSocket Chat

Once the server is running, you can connect to the WebSocket chat server using any WebSocket client. Here's how you can connect:

- WebSocket URL: `ws://localhost:8000/chat`

## Commands

For ease of setup and usage, refer to the following commands:

- **Creating a Virtual Environment:**

  ```bash
  python -m venv your-environment-name
  ```

- **Activating the Virtual Environment:**

  ```bash
  # On Windows
  cd your-environment-name\Scripts
  activate

  # On macOS/Linux
  source your-environment-name/bin/activate
  ```

- **Running the Server:**

  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
